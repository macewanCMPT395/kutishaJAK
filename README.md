#### The Ushahidi Analytics Initiative
Here at the kutishaJAK headquarters, the ultimate goal of our project was to bring about an improved method for representing and communicating meaningful patterns in data.  Specifically, we wanted to analyze and present the end user with useful visual feedback in regards to the incident reports supported by the Ushahidi platform and its many deployments.  We achieved this through the adoption of filterable graphs that the user is able to actively manipulate with their desired datasets.  From this effort, our Analytics plugin for the Ushahidi platform was born.
